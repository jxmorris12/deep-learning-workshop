## Project guidelines
The main idea is to build something cool using deep learning. That could either be in the research direction (proposing and developing a new idea) or in the engineering direction (building a system that does something cool). This probably requires finding a unique and interesting dataset to work on. 

These days there are really good open-source language models that can answer questions, write essays, and produce human-like text; there are also good open models in audio and vision and some other domains. I would think about what models and data are available and use that to generate ideas. 

## Frequently asked questions

Does model fine-tuning count as a project?
- Yes, model fine-tuning counts; prompting counts too; I'm more concerned that you build something that interests you and you put thought into it

Can I work in a group?
- sure

What compute should I use?
- You'll need to train the model using free Colab credits or on your own laptop

What dataset should I use?
- There are so many datasets online, or you can collect your own! For inspiration see this collection: https://huggingface.co/datasets
