## Course description

Students will learn deep neural network fundamentals and practical skills for training and evaluating these networks. We will practice using a variety of tools in real-world scenarios to prepare students for practical deep learning problems seen in both research and industry.

## Project

All students will complete a small project at the end of the semester to test their new deep learning skills. The goal is to build something that uses contemporary technology to do something interesting and exciting and to showcase your skills as an engineer.
